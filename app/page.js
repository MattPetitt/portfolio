            I'm an Engineering Manager with 15+ years of experience bridging the
            gap between design, development, and business. I've worked at
            scrappy three-person startups and global mega-corporations and
            learned the best from both worlds. I specialize in shipping complex
            UIs, design systems, and developer tools that empower organizations
            to build and scale high-quality experiences efficiently. I stay
            hands-on where it matters, balancing technical excellence with
            business priorities.
